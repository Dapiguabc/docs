Every Blockchain Network consists of nodes. The node plays significant role in work of blockchain by implementation rules of concensus.


There are two types of nodes: 

* Masternode
* Delegate

A delegate is a 'processor' of the blockchain while the masternodes are the 'storage' of the blockchain.
Delegates process the transactions and maintain state, but they do not keep the blockchain/are not required to.

By separating the processing from the storage, we have a more secure system that is less prone to collusion.

The masternodes cannot modify the results from the delegates because they are cryptographically signed.
