At no point does the Lamden Wallet do an Automatic Backup. **All backups are MANUAL and the user's responsibilty.**

## When to backup
A backup must be created EVERY TIME a new account is added to your Lamden Wallet. This includes <u>[Linked Accounts](/docs/wallet/accounts_linked_overview)</u>.

## Backup Options
There are a couple of ways to backup your Lamden Wallet Accounts and either will allow you restore an account later:
1. Create <u>[Keystore File](/docs/wallet/backup_keystore)</u> 
    - This is an encrypted file that contains the keypairs associated with your account
2. View <u>[Secret Keys](/docs/wallet/backup_view_keys)</u>
    - Some people prefer to write the secret keys down manually and store them offline

These are the only ways to backup your accounts.

## Backing up Linked Accounts
A Keystore file will include the <u>[keypairs](/docs/wallet/accounts_linked_overview)</u> for your Linked Accounts but the DAPP association will be lost.

When the Linked Account keypairs are restored you can follow this process to re-link you account to the DAPP.
