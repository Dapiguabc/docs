The Lamden Vault can connect to two networks:

1. **Lamden Mainnet**: This is the main Lamden Network where `TAU` is the currency that pays for transactions.
2. **Lamden Testnet**: This is the main Lamden Network where `dTAU` is the currency that pays for transactions.

There are 2 ways to change between `Mainnet` and `Testnet`

1. Click the `Current Network` box in the upper right hand corner of the Wallet.
    - Clicking this box will toggle between `Mainnet` and `Testnet`.
2. Click `Developer Tools` on the left-hand wallet menu
    - From the `Current Network` drop-down box you can select which network you want.


## Clearing Network Cache
The wallet uses some internal cacheing for wallet balances. If you find your balances incorrect for whatever reason try clearing the network cache.
1. Click `Developer Tools` on the left-hand wallet menu.
2. From the `Current Network` drop-down box you can select which network you want to clear the cache on.
3. Click the `CLEAR NETWORK CACHE` button.
