## Existing Account
This will create you an account based off an existing account's Private Key.  This is a way to restore accounts that you have backed up manually and not with a keystore file.

1. From the left-hand menu select "Accounts"
2. Click the "Add Accounts" button
3. Select "Lamden" from the Account Type dropdown (default)
5. Click the "Add Existing" button (default)
6. Enter the PRIVATE KEY in the "Private Key" box
7. Enter a Nickname for your new Account in the "Account Nickname" box
8. Click the "Save" button

## Track Account
Sometimes you may want to track an Account that you don't own.  This option will allow you to input any Account address and it will show up in your Lamden wallet. Because you did not add this address with the Private Key, you will not be able to make transactions with this account.

1. From the left-hand menu select "Accounts"
2. Click the "Add Accounts" button
3. Select "Lamden" from the Account Type dropdown (default)
5. Click the "Track Address" button (default)
6. Enter the Account Address in the "Account Address" box
7. Enter a Nickname for this new Account in the "Account Nickname" box
8. Click the "Save" button
