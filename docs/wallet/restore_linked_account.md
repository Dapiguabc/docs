Restored Accounts via <u>[Keystore](/docs/wallet/accounts_linked_overview)</u> or <u>[Secret Key](/docs/wallet/accounts_creation#existing-account)</u> will not have retained their <u>[Linked Account](/docs/wallet/accounts_linked_overview)</u>  information and will need to be manually re-linked to the Dapp that created them.

1. Visit the website of the Dapp you wish to link to and initiate a connection to the Lamden Vault
2. Follow the <u>[Create Linked Account](/docs/wallet/accounts_linked_create)</u> process to create a new Linked Account in the Lamden Vault.

The Dapp is now re-linked to the account you restored.  All of your smart contract associations you had before, to tokens, or NFTs you will now have control over.
