Restored Accounts via <u>[Keystore](/docs/wallet/accounts_linked_overview)</u> or <u>[Secret Key](/docs/wallet/accounts_creation#existing-account)</u> will not have retained their <u>[Linked Account](/docs/wallet/accounts_linked_overview)</u>  information and will need to be manually re-liked to the DAPP that created them.

1. Visit the website of the DAPP you wish to link to and initate a connection to the Lamden Wallet
2. Follow the <u>[Create Linked Account](/docs/wallet/accounts_linked_create)</u> process to create a new Linked Account in the Lamden Wallet. **Ignore the Fund part of this process**.
3. On the Lamden Wallet left-hand menu, click `Accounts`.
4. Click on the account you WANT to be linked to the DAPP (not the newly created one).
5. Click the `Options` button
6. Select the DAPP from the `Currently Linked Accounts` dropdown. 
7. Click, `OK` on the popup

The DAPP is now re-linked to the account you restored.  All of your smart contract associations you had before, to tokens, or NFTs you will now have control over.
