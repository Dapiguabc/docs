Revoking access removes the permission granteded to the DAPP during the <u>[Linked Account Creation](/docs/wallet/accounts_linked_create)</u> process.  

Revoking access **DOES NOT** delete the Linked Account from your wallet it only removes the ability of the DAPP to send transaction.


## Reestablishing a Linked Account
If you wish to reestablish a connection with thie linked account you can revisit the DAPPS website. The DAPP will treat you as a new user and you will need to follow the <u>[Linked Account Creation](/docs/wallet/accounts_linked_create)</u> process again.  The only difference is this time no **NEW** Linked Account is created; instead the DAPP is Linked Back to the existing Linked Account.
