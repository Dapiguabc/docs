# Revoke Access to your Lamden Vault

Revoking access removes the permission granted to the Dapp during the <u>[Linked Account Creation](/docs/wallet/accounts_linked_create)</u> process.  

Revoking access **DOES NOT** delete the Linked Account from your wallet. It only removes the ability of the Dapp to send transactions.


## Reestablishing a Linked Account
If you wish to re-establish a connection with the linked account you can revisit the Dapps website. The Dapp will treat you as a new user and you will need to follow the <u>[Linked Account Creation](/docs/wallet/accounts_linked_create)</u> process again. The only difference is that this time no **NEW** Linked Account is created. Instead, the Dapp is linked back to the existing Linked Account.
