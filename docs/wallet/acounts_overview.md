Wallet accounts store your TAU token in the Lamden Wallet.

You can have multiple wallet accounts, each of them has their own unique address which is encrypted in the Lamden Wallet.

It is heavily recommened that you do a NEW BACKUP everytime you add a new account as each backup only stores the accounts you had at that specific point in time.
