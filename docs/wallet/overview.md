# Lamden Vault Overview

The Lamden Vault is a Metamask type wallet for the Lamden Blockchain.
With it you can create account to manage your TAU and Lamden Tokens.
The Lamden Vault also lets you create connections to Dapps via the browser.

The Lamden Vault is now using a unique 24-word phrase that is generated when you first set up to manage your accounts.
We called the 24-word phrase "Secret Recovery Phrase". Your funds are connected to that phrase. If you ever lose your password, your Secret Recovery Phrase allows you to recover your wallet and your funds. Write it down on paper and hide it somewhere, put it in a safety deposit box, or use a secure password manager.
The Lamden Vault also has a number of features that allow the user to interface directly with the Lamden Blockchain.
