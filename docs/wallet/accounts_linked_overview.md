A Linked Account is an account created in your Lamden Wallet by a website that you have approved to interact with your Lamden Wallet.  This approval is done via a popup window when you visit the website.

Each website that you interact with will have its own Linked Account. This lets you, as the user, control how much of your TAU that each application has access to.

This is an example of what a linked account looks like in the Lamden Wallet.
