# What is a transaction on the Lamden Network?


All transactions on the Lamden Network are smart contract transactions.

When you create a transaction you are specifying:
- The `name` of the smart contract.
- the `method/function` of the smart contract you want to execute.
- The `arguments` to provide to the smart contract.

### Prerequisites

#### Stamps
Transactions on the Lamden Network are paid for in "Stamps". Stamps are converted to TAU in the system and deducted from your wallet balance.
If you do not have a sufficient TAU balance then your Tx will either fail to be accepted by the network or fail during execution.
